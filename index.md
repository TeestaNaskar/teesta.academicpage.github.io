I am Teesta Naskar, a post doctoral fellow at Yasmin Hurd lab in the Neuroscience department of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA. My research interests lie in investigating how early environmental exposures influence brain development, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral manifestations. I am committed to uncovering the underlying mechanisms by which various environmental factors during critical periods of brain development contribute to the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric conditions.
